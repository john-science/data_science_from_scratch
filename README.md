# Data Science from Scratch

This repository is a collection of iPython note books generated by working through the O'Reilly book `Data Science from Scratch` by Joel Grus, first edition.

This repository is in no way an official representation of the book. I am in no way affiliated with O'Reilly or Joel's Book. Please consider this repository a student's note book.

#### Technology Stack
 
The technology stack I used while working through this book is much as the book intended. But for the sake of clarity, here is an exact list of the tools used in this project:

 * Anaconda 2.3.0 (Linux 64-bit)
 * Python 3.4
 * iPython 3.2.0
 * matplotlib 1.4.3
 * numpy 1.9.2

This technology stack should be fairly platform independent, but in case it matters I ran under a standard build of Ubuntu 14.04.
