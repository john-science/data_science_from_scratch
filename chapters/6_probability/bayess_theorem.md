# Bayes' Theorem

In the trenches of science, no battle has lasted longer or become more fierce than the one between Frequentists and Bayesians. If you think no one is going to war over probability theory, you're wrong. And don't let anyone tell you that one side has claimed victory. Thomas Bayes died in 1761 and at this point it is a holy war; no one will win. The best you can do is understand the two approaches and give them both a healthy dose of skepticism. 

To that end, let's take a look at Bayes' Theorem.

#### The Equation

Like a lot of great ideas, Bayes' Theorem can be written down in a single equation, but understanding all the implications takes time.

Seemingly every pocket protector on the intertubes has their own explanation for Bayes' Theorem. Caveat emptor.
