# Bayes' Theorem

For a long time now, scientists have argued between two different approaches to probabilities: Frequentist and Bayesian. The argument is old, but both sides have become more polarized and fierce over time. Perhaps it is a testiment to how much people care about doing science right. Or perhaps it is just another example of the Narcissism of Small Differences.

In order to join the conversation in the modern world of data science, or statistics at large, you will need to understand Bayes' Theorem.

Seemingly every pocket protector on the intertubes has their own explanation for Bayes' Theorem. Caveat emptor.
